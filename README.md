# Retail Sales Analysis Using SQL
## Project Overview
This project showcases essential SQL skills and techniques commonly used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. It involves setting up a retail sales database, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and using SQL queries to answer key business questions. Ideal for beginners in data analysis, this project helps build a strong foundation in SQL.

## Objectives
1. Set up a Retail Sales Database: Create and populate a retail sales database using the provided sales data.
2. Data Cleaning: Detect and remove records containing missing or null values.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct basic EDA to gain a clear understanding of the dataset.
4. Business Analysis: Leverage SQL queries to answer key business questions and extract meaningful insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure
